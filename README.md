- How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

To ensure that my code, program, or software is both functional and secure, I focus on creating detailed tests and utilizing industry best practices. First, I like to create unit tests to ensure that individual components work correctly and then I perform integration testing to ensure that the individual components interact with each other as outlined in the requirements. I also use debugging tools and follow best practices to prevent errors. For the security side of things, I can validate user input and run regular security assessments to mitigate potential vulnerabilities as soon as possible. By combining detailed testing with best security practices, I can create software that is reliable, safe, and meets user needs.

- How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Understanding user needs is the most important part of developing a program. I first like to gather the requirements and break them into tasks (bullet points) in my notes. I then prioritize these tasks, deciding which features should be completed first and which need to be finished before other parts can be developed. As I develop these individual components, I look back at my notes to ensure that I am meeting all of the requirements. For me, I like breaking down the requirements into small pieces because it makes it less daunting and keeps me on track throughout development.

- How do I approach designing software?

My mindset when designing software is to stay organized, focused, and flexible. I approach each project by breaking down requirements into smaller tasks, planning the overall structure, and thinking about how the components will work together. I stay open to making adjustments as I test and develop the program because I know that my intial design will change throughout development. By staying open-minded and thinking like the end user, I can create software that is efficient, maintainable, and meets the needs of its users.
